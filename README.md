# CMSC421---Project-2---Front-End-Basics
2nd Project for CMSC 421 (Web Development) Course at Millersville University.

The goal of this project was to learn the basics of Front-End Web Development.

To do this, I created 3 games (2 of them chosen by Professor Xie). Each game has its own HTML & JavaScript file, and all share a CSS file.

The project was created using CodeSandbox. This repository contains the contents of the zip folder for the project.
